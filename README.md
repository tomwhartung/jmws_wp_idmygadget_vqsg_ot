# jmws_wp_vqsg_fs_idMyGadget

This is the minimal WordPress theme built From Scratch, that is available from http://www.wpvisualquickstart.com/reference/our-theme/ .

It is from the book WordPress Visual Quick Start Guide (I have the Second Edition).

I am adding the idMyGadget Device Detection to this.

## Specific Changes Made

### header.php

* Changed doctype to html

* Added theme name to title (TODO: REMOVE THIS)
