# jmws_wp_vqsg_fs_idMyGadget

This is the minimal WordPress theme built From Scratch, that is available from .

It is from the book WordPress Visual Quick Start Guide (I have the Second Edition).

I am adding the idMyGadget Device Detection to this.

At this point I do not know how this will turn out, so there's not much else left to say.
